# Synco
Synco uses Firebase's Realtime Database to synchronize a color across multiple devices, in real time.

To set up your project use [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) detailed guide on how to add Firebase to your iOS App. You will need to add your own ´GoogleService-Info.plist´ in the root directory of your Xcode project.
